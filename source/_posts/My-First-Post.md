## 👩‍💻 About Me

**Amber (Yi) Yang** is a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas, supervised by **Prof. Ovidiu Daescu**. Her research spans two broad areas: **medical imaging in lung cancer** and **explainable AI for chemistry**.

In the medical domain, she focuses on applying **computer vision techniques** to improve **pulmonary nodule detection** in low-dose CT scans — an area with growing interest in:

- 🔍 Multi-scale feature learning
- 🌫️ Uncertainty-aware segmentation
- 🏥 AI-assisted clinical decision support

In parallel, she is building **interpretable deep learning frameworks** to solve problems in **computational chemistry**, particularly **power conversion efficiency (PCE)** prediction in **organic photovoltaic (OPV)** materials.

Her research integrates scientific domain knowledge with cutting-edge ML techniques, emphasizing transparency, model robustness, and practical impact. She has **5+ years of biology research experience** and has previously worked as a **research scientist at an mRNA therapeutics company**, contributing to both experimental workflows and **IND (Investigational New Drug) applications**.

Amber is passionate about bridging scientific research and real-world applications through machine learning. She is always open to discussing research ideas, collaborative opportunities, and industry-facing applications of her work.
