👋 **Hello and welcome!**

I'm currently a PhD student in **Computer Science**, actively exploring two exciting research areas:

### 🩻 Medical Imaging  
We're dedicated to improving **image segmentation** techniques, aiming for more accurate and reliable medical diagnostics. 📈🧑‍⚕️

### ⚗️ AI for Chemistry  
We've recently developed a more **explainable machine learning framework**, which clearly interprets how each feature contributes to target value predictions. Our goal is to bridge the gap between powerful predictions and clear interpretability. 🔍🤖

Before embarking on my CS journey, I spent over **5 years** in biological research 🧬, plus **2 years** as a Research Scientist at an **mRNA therapeutics company**. My professional experience also covers the **Investigational New Drug (IND) application process** and project management. 📋💊

I'll regularly update my latest research progress and insights here—stay tuned! 🚀✨
